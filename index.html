    <h2>Why I picked the topic:</h2>
        <p>There were two reasons that drove me towards this project. I picked this particular subject because my family is originally from Central America so the Mayan culture is something which is in our history. Secondly, when I was younger my brother introduced me to coding and I instantly liked it, which is why I thought i'd be a good idea to build a site to present this project.</p>

    <h3>Who the Maya's are:</h3>
    <p>The Maya are indigenous people who reside in Mexico and many countries in Central America such as Guatemala, Belize, El Salvador and Honduras. The term Maya actually comes from Mayapan which was an ancient city in Yucatan located in Mexico. Many to this day believe that the Mayas vanished completely and while that is partly true as you will see theres still some Mayan civilizations that exist even today.</p>
