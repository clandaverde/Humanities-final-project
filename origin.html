    <h2> The Mayas weren't the first indigenous people to live in Mexico/Central America. In fact it wasnt until the classic Maya period in which they started becoming more and more present in these areas.</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>The Archaic period (7000-2000 BCE)</li>
        <p>During this time nomadic people began cultivating crops and plants. They also began establishing villages and sacred temples to worship gods.</p>
        <li>The Olmec Period (1500-200 BCE)</li>
        <p>They are known to be one of the oldest civilizations in Mesoamerica. They were able to develope quite well, with building big cities made out of stone and brick. They're also known for having made sophisticated sculptures and establishing groundwork for future civilizations as well.</p>
        <li>The Zapotec Period (600 BCE - 800 CE)</li>
        <p>They were greatly influenced by the Olmecs and through them things like writing, mathematics, astronomy, and even the development of the calendar took place.</p>
        <li>The Teotihuacan Period (200-900 CE)</li>
        <p>They actually grew from being a small village to an enormous city. It’s said that Teotihuacan was a place where many came to worship their religious beliefs. </p>
        <li>The Classic Maya Period (250-940 CE)</li>
        <p>During this time great power began to rise in the cities of Yucatan. In some places the cultures of previous indigenous people were present but, in many places, a whole new culture which were the Maya’s began to emerge. During this time the Mayas were at their peak and even perfected mathematics, astronomy, architecture, the visual arts and even the calendar. </p>
        <li>The Post-classic Period (950-1524 CE)</li>
        <p>During the post-classic period the great Maya’s cities began to fall. To date there is no explanation as to what accurately happened, but many archeologists suggest that it was due to overpopulation, warfare and extended droughts.  </p>
